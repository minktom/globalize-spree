# GlobalizeSpree

Localizing model data in Spree using Globalize3.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tomash/globalize-spree.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tomash/globalize-spree)



## Installation


Add to Gemfile:

    gem "globalize_spree", :git => 'git://github.com/tomash/globalize-spree.git'

Also, to be super-sure (I've ran into some trouble before that, needs investigation) add

    gem "i18n"
    gem "globalize3"

to your application Gemfile as well.

Now run install to copy migrations and run them:

    bundle exec rails g globalize_spree:install


## Usage

Works OOTB.

Currently globalizes: Product (name, description), Taxon (name).

### Basic usage (vanilla Globalize way)

Basically works like Globalize, so
   
    # set the locale or do not to leave default one
    I18n.locale = :en
    # and you are ready to go
    Product.last.name # <= get name for this product for :en locale
    Product.last.name = "something" # <= set name for this product for :en locale

### Easy Globalize Accessors

For easy editing of translated stuff for predefined locales, it uses code from easy-globalize2-accessors. Inside self.activate of your lib/spree_site.rb put

    Product.class_eval do
      globalize_accessors :pl, :en, :de
    end

And spree-globalize will replace Product form's "name" field with, respectively, "name_pl", "name_en" and "name_de" fields ("description" following same pattern) in admin panel. Try it!


## ToDo

More models.
